Hi, I have designed this program like a complete product, I have implemented using multilevel linked list (this how hashmap implemented),
This program can be done using hashmap easily but I have not used any built-in data structures but I have used
data structure concept to solve this problem.

I covered most of the test cases, you can exclude and include any time, based on that distributors and its sub-distributors will
updated automatically, any exclusion in parent level distributor will update all of its sub-distributors also.

you can add any number of distributors and sub-distributors at any time, and I am maintaining a hierarchy of permissions also,
(e.g) if all cities are excluded from province then province will be removed for that distributor, same case for province also,
      When all province is removed then the country will be removed for its distributors. and these changes will be updated in its all sub-distributors also

Also distributors also well organized like when you try to assign sub-distributor for non-existing distributor then it will throw an error

Implementation is little complex but this how hashmap internally work


Note: To create new distributor or switch to already existing distributor use option "1" in the main menu
      if distributor not exist then it will create a new one, else switch to already existing distributor
